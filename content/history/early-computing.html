  <h1>Early Computing</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Mechanical Roots</h2>
    <p>Before electronic computers, people built mechanical devices to assist calculation. Notable examples include the abacus, Pascal's calculator (1642), and Charles Babbage's designs for the Difference Engine and Analytical Engine (1830s).</p>

    <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
    <p>Working with Babbage, Ada Lovelace wrote notes that described how the Analytical Engine could compute Bernoulli numbers. These notes are often considered the first published computer program (1843).</p>

    <h2>From Theory to Machines</h2>
    <p>Alan Turing's 1936 paper introduced the idea of a universal machine, shaping the theory of computation. In the 1940s, electronic, programmable machines such as ENIAC and Colossus brought computing into the electronic era.</p>
